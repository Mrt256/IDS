## Intrusion Detection System with Machine Learning
###### This code is part of a Bachelor's Thesis
This project features an innovative Intrusion Detection System developed using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency in identifying malicious activities and network traffic anomalies, moving beyond traditional signature-based methods.

The ML model is trained to recognize complex attack patterns and distinguish normal network behavior from intrusion attempts, thereby providing a proactive and adaptive security layer.
